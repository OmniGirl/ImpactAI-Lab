# Learning Coach Workflow

## Goal
Test how an AI assistant framed as a "learning coach" guides users through problem-solving.

---

## Steps

1. **Input:** User asks a question or presents a problem.
2. **Clarify:** AI asks 1–3 clarifying questions to understand context.
3. **Breakdown:** AI decomposes the problem into smaller steps or concepts.
4. **Guide:** AI provides hints or reasoning strategies without giving direct answers.
5. **Check:** AI asks the user to reflect and attempt the next step.
6. **Reveal (Optional):** If the user requests, AI gives the solution explicitly.
7. **Feedback:** Document any deviations, user confusion, or unexpected outputs.

## Hypotheses

- Explicit role framing increases reasoning depth.
- Users exposed to iterative hints retain more understanding.
- Direct answers decrease engagement and cognitive effort.

---

## Next Iterations

- Adaptive feedback based on user confidence.
- Compare “coach” vs “tutor” vs “peer” framing.
- Test multi-step vs single-step hinting.

## Notes

This workflow is **intentional but flexible**.  
Every step will be tracked in `experiments/learnings.md` as results emerge.
