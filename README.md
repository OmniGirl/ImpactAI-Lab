# ImpactAI Lab

🚀 **Key Artifacts**

- [Learning Coach Prompt](assistant/prompts/learning_coach.md) – Early prompt experiments
- [Learning Coach Workflow](assistant/workflows/learning_coach_workflow.md) – Step-by-step workflow design
- [Week 1 Reflection](reflections/week-1.md) – Insights, failures, next steps


This is a living lab for exploring applied AI systems through experiments, reflections, and iterative design.  
This repository is a **demonstration of my thinking, building, and learning velocity**.

##  Structure

- **assistant/** – AI assistant experiments, including prompts, workflows, and examples.
- **experiments/** – Documented learning, failed approaches, and hypotheses.
- **docs/** – System and architecture notes.
- **reflections/** – Weekly reflections capturing insights and decisions.

##  Philosophy

I explore AI not as a black box, but as a **system to reason with, shape, and understand**.  
I prioritize:

1. **Learning by doing:** Rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration.  
2. **Documenting the why:** Every design, prompt, and workflow has rationale.  
3. **Failing smartly:** Dead ends are recorded as signals, not mistakes.  
4. **Reflecting often:** Weekly reflections improve both product and process.

##  Example Early Insights

- Framing AI as a **“coach”** rather than an “answer engine” increases engagement and reasoning depth.  
- Role constraints in prompts change output patterns subtly but meaningfully.  
- Iterative experimentation surfaces assumptions faster than isolated coding or reading papers.

##  Next Steps

1. Expand prompt experiments with varied cognitive strategies.  
2. Build workflow-level experiments to test assistant reasoning.  
3. Continue weekly reflections, documenting trade-offs, failures, and insights.
