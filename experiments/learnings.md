# Learnings Log

This repository is a living record of how I explore AI system behavior
through prompt design, structure, and iteration.

The goal is not polished demos, but rapid understanding.

## Learning 1: Prompt Framing Changes Cognitive Behavior

**Observation**
When the assistant is framed as a “coach” instead of an “answer engine”,
its responses become more exploratory and adaptive.

**Hypothesis**
Explicit role constraints influence reasoning depth and interaction quality.

**Next Step**
Test variations:
- Coach with strict refusal to answer
- Coach with delayed answer reveal
- Coach that mirrors user reasoning

## Meta Reflection

I am optimizing for learning velocity rather than surface performance.
I expect some experiments to fail.
Those failures are signals, not waste.
